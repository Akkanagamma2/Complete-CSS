        <p class="para">The first time you log in to Salesforce, the IP address is cached in your browser. Anytime you log in from a different IP address, you will be asked to verify your identity, typically by entering a verification code. You can bypass this step for trusted IP ranges. For example, suppose that your users should be able to log in without entering a verification code whenever they are in the office.</p>
